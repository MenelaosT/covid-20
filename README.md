# covid-19

The purpose of [this notebook](https://github.com/dim02/covid-19/blob/master/cov.ipynb) is to present graphically the most recent data on confirmed cases and deaths from covid-19.

### Data
- Covid-19 data are taken from the [2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) repository.

#### Important notes
* The number of confirmed cases are lower that the actual number of cases. This means that the mortality rates that are shown are higher than the true mortality rates.
* The exponential fit is performed using data only up to the date that corresponds to the inflection point of the logistic fit curve.
* Greece is not currently in the lists of countries with the highest numbers of confirmed cases or deaths, but is nevertheless included in the plots.
